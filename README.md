Create a small app that pulls an image feed from a publically available API (Instagram, Flickr, etc.) and display them in a collectionview/tableview.

Here are some of the requirements:
- The app should have a mechanism to refresh the feed
- The app should have pagination support
- It will be a huge plus if it includes video
- Create the project in Github and share it with the following usernames: kenchung, jinhokim77
- And last but not least, be creative and have fun!
